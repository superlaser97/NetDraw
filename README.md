# NetDraw

Current version: `v1.4.0`

NetDraw is a self-contained browser-based network diagram editor. The app lives in `NetDraw.html` and runs locally without a build step or server.

This project is based on `mr-r3b00t.github.io/net_draw/` with enhancements.

## Open

Open `NetDraw.html` directly in a modern browser.

```bash
xdg-open NetDraw.html
```

If `xdg-open` is not available, open the file from your browser with `File -> Open`.

## Features

- Drag network, server, endpoint, people, Docker, HULFT, A-AUTO, place, process, and threat objects onto the canvas.
- Add AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, HULFT, and A-AUTO service objects from palette sections below Docker, with cloud service names sourced from the official provider icon packages.
- Connect nodes and zones with styled links, labels, structured routes, arrows, animated traffic, and sneakernet paths.
- Create zones and swimlanes for network segments and process lanes.
- Add free-form **Notes** from the palette's Annotations section: each note has a title chip and wrapped body text, auto-grows to fit, and can still be tagged with filters/layers or connected like any other object.
- Create multiple pages from bottom tabs; each page keeps its own canvas and view.
- Build page-level journey walkthroughs with ordered reveal/highlight steps and captions.
- Search the current page by object label, device name, IP address, or DNS name from the topbar search box, then jump straight to a match.
- Resize objects and zones from selection handles.
- Copy and paste selected objects or groups with their internal connections using NetDraw's in-page clipboard.
- Edit labels, metadata, disposition, effects, colors, lane names, and edge styles from the properties panel, including multiple selected objects at once with mixed-value indicators.
- Labels wrap automatically and support manual line breaks; cards, label tags, and swimlane title bands grow to fit.
- Pan by dragging empty canvas, zoom with the mouse wheel or toolbar, and fit the diagram to view.
- Toggle light and dark mode from the top toolbar.
- Collapse and expand individual palette sections, or use the top palette control to collapse or expand all sections at once.
- Save and load diagrams as one JSON file, including all pages.
- Reset the full document from the upper-right trash button after a warning confirmation.
- Export diagrams as PNG, SVG, or animated GIF. PNG and GIF exports include NetDraw and the current version in image software metadata.
- Record the visible canvas as video with optional microphone or music audio; supported browsers offer available WebM/MP4 recording formats.

## Local Browser Storage

NetDraw stores the current document, page view positions, theme, and sidebar collapse state in browser `localStorage`.

On startup:

- If a valid local diagram exists, NetDraw restores it.
- If no valid local diagram exists, NetDraw starts with a clear canvas.

Use the `Save` button to export a portable JSON file containing every page in the document. Use `Open` to import a saved JSON diagram. Older single-page NetDraw JSON files are imported as a one-page document.

The upper-right trash button performs a full reset: after confirmation, NetDraw deletes every page in the current document and starts a new blank `Page 1`.

## Pages

Use the tabs along the bottom edge of the canvas to switch pages. Click `+` to add a page, double-click a page tab to rename it, and use the trash button to delete the current page. A document must always have at least one page.

## Connections

Select a connection to edit its label, line style, route, source point, destination point, arrow direction, and animated traffic flow from the properties panel.

Connection routes can be `Curved`, `Straight`, or `Elbow`. Existing diagrams default to `Curved`. For `Elbow` routes, select the connection and drag the bend handles on the line to move the structured path.

Connections can attach to the `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom`, or `Left` point on each object or zone. Drag from a visible object side point or use Connect mode on a zone to create a pinned connection, or change `From point` and `To point` on an existing connection.

Arrow options are `None`, `Start with`, `End with`, and `Two-way`. Animated traffic flow follows the selected start or end arrow direction; two-way arrows keep the current single-line animation behavior.

## Objects

Select a node to show corner resize handles, then drag a handle to resize the object. Existing diagrams keep their automatic object sizes until an object is resized.

The Effects / status list includes operational states such as `Down`, `Missing`, and `Unavailable`, along with security-focused states.

Select a node, zone, swimlane, or connection to move it backward, forward, to the back, or to the front from the properties panel. Ordering is applied inside the selected item's drawing layer.

## Notes

Add a **Note** from the **Annotations** palette section to place free-form text on the canvas. A note is drawn as a rounded, solid-bordered box with a title chip at the top-left and wrapped body text underneath; it grows automatically to fit its content.

Select a note and edit its **Title** and **Text** in the properties panel. Notes support the same filters/layers tagging, accent color, ordering, resizing, copy/paste, and connections as other objects, and their text is included in object search.

## AWS

The AWS palette section contains 305 service entries from the official AWS Architecture Icons package published on April 30, 2026. Each AWS object uses the official AWS service SVG graphic and preserves the official service name in the palette and object label.

## Google Cloud Platform

The Google Cloud Platform palette section sits directly under AWS and contains 250 de-duplicated entries from the official Google Cloud product icon packages: product category icons, core product icons, and legacy console icons. Each Google Cloud object uses the official Google Cloud SVG graphic and preserves the product or category name in the palette and object label.

## Azure

The Azure palette section sits directly under Google Cloud Platform and contains 624 de-duplicated service entries from the official Microsoft Azure Architecture Icons SVG package, version 23. Each Azure object uses the official Azure SVG graphic and preserves the service name in the palette and object label.

## HULFT

The HULFT palette section sits directly under Azure and contains product-fit icons for HULFT10 file transfer diagrams: HULFT Server, HULFT Manager, HULFT API Gateway, Send File, Receive File, File ID, Send Management Info, Receive Management Info, Transfer Group, Host Information, Job Information, File Trigger, Format Information, Code Conversion, Cipher Option, Cloud Storage Option, Operation Log, and HULFT Cluster.

## A-AUTO

The A-AUTO palette section sits directly under HULFT and contains product-fit icons for A-AUTO job scheduling diagrams: A-AUTO Scheduler, Job Network, Batch Job, Schedule Date, Progress Monitor, A-AUTO Agent, A-AUTO/LINK, A-SUPERVISION Client, ERP Job, Heterogeneous Platforms, Carryover Job, and 24/365 Operation.

## Journey

Use `Journey` to create a guided walkthrough for the current page. Add steps, pick the objects each step reveals, write captions, and play the journey with the presentation controls. Journey steps are saved in the exported JSON document with their page.
