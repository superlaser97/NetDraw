# Changelog

## v1.1.11 - 2026-10-02

- Updated the displayed NetDraw version to `v1.1.11`.
- Added filters/layers: create document-wide named, colored filters in a new Filters panel, then tag any node, connection, zone, or swimlane from its properties panel (single or multi-selection).
- Toggling one or more filters dims every object that does not match; connections stay visible when tagged or when both endpoints match.
- SVG/PNG/GIF exports prompt to render the full diagram or exactly what is on screen while filters are active.

## v1.1.10 - 2026-10-02

- Updated the displayed NetDraw version to `v1.1.10`.
- Added multi-object properties editing: select two or more nodes, connections, zones, or swimlanes to edit labels, shared fields, disposition, effects, colors, and connection settings together, with mixed-value indicators.
- Added automatic label wrapping with manual line breaks; the in-canvas label editor is now a multiline textarea (Enter commits, Shift+Enter adds a line).
- Object, connection, zone, and swimlane sizing now measures wrapped text so cards, label tags, and swimlane title bands grow to fit.
- Dragging a zone now also moves any zones nested inside it, recursively, along with their member objects.
- The properties panel now scrolls when its content overflows the viewport.

## v1.1.9 - 2026-08-16

- Updated the displayed NetDraw version to `v1.1.9`.
